# 2 Pointers

## Concepts
- Use 2 pointers to access different elements for comparision and data manipulation.

## Sub-patterns
### Fast slow pointers
- Concepts
   - The fast pointer moves two steps and the slow pointer moves one step.
- Problems can use this patterns
   - Find the middle element of a linked list.

### Brute force pointers
- Concepts
   - One pointer moves one step each time while another pointer points to the element next to the first pointer and move to the end.

### Meet pointers
- Concepts
   - Each pointer start from each end and they move toward each other.

### Neighbor pointers
- Concepts
   - 2 pointers next to each other and move together from one end to another.

### Constant distance pointer
- Concepts
   - 2 pointers keep a constant distance and move together from one end to another.
- Problems can use this patterns
   - Get the Nth node from the tail of a linked list.
