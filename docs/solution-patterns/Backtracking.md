# Backtracking

## Concepts
- Backtracking is to find all or some feasible solutions for constraint satisfaction problems (A set of objects whose state must satisfy a number of constraints or limitations).

## Algorithm
- Basic idea
   - Incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.
- Search tree
   - Structure
      - The root node is a empty candidate with 0 elements.
      - Each node is a candidates with partial elements 
      - Each child node is generated by adding a new element from the parent node (Going from parent to child is a single extension step).
   - Example

   - Process
      - Traverse the search tree by depth-first search.
      - For each node:
         - If the current node is not a valid solution, the sub-tree from the current node can be ignored.
         - If the current node is a valid solution
            - Recurse on all the child nodes from the current node.
